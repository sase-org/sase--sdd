# Plan: Add concise Qwen handoff note to `sase-3a`

## Goal

Review the most recent Qwen agents that actually ran, identify what slowed them down, and add a concise note to the
`sase-3a` epic bead so future phase agents avoid the same failure mode.

## Evidence

- `sase agents status -a -j` shows the most recent executed Qwen agents are `sase-3a.3`, `sase-3a.2`, and `sase-3a.1`;
  newer Qwen entries are waiting and have not run yet.
- `sase chats show --agent sase-3a.3 -f raw` shows that the agent completed the symbol cleanup but repeatedly hit merge
  conflicts in `sdd/beads/issues.jsonl` while trying to close/commit the bead.
- `sase chats show --agent sase-3a.1 -f raw` shows the same bead-store conflict pattern while closing/committing after
  the code change.
- `sase chats show --agent sase-3a.2 -f raw` shows a clean run, so the useful future-agent note should focus on the
  conflict-handling pattern seen in the other two runs.

## Implementation

1. Inspect the current `sase-3a` epic bead notes.
2. Update only the `sase-3a` epic bead notes with no more than three sentences.
3. Include the required merge-conflict instruction: abort the merge, stash changes, sync with master, and then close the
   bead again.
4. Verify the final bead note with `sase bead show sase-3a`.

## Validation

- No code changes are planned, so `just check` is not needed.
- The expected modified state is limited to `sdd/beads/issues.jsonl` through `sase bead update`.

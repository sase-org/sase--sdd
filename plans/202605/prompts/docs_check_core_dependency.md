  GitHub Actions is failing with the below error. Can you help me diagnose the root cause of this issue and fix it? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill before making any file changes.

Run just docs-check

  ╰─▶ Because sase-core-rs was not found in the package registry and
      sase==0.1.0 depends on sase-core-rs>=0.1.1,<0.2.0, we can conclude that
      sase==0.1.0 cannot be used.
      And because only sase[dev]==0.1.0 is available and you require
      sase[dev], we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

# Pyvision: Exclude Test Files From Public Symbol Reference Detection

## Goal

Make `pyvision` treat references to a public symbol from Python test files as **insufficient** to consider that symbol
"used." If a public symbol is referenced **only** by test files, pyvision should flag it as unused (the same way it
would if the symbol had no references at all).

The intent is to keep test-only symbols out of the production codebase: tests should exercise code that exists for a
non-test reason, not be the only justification for a symbol's existence.

## Current Behavior

Pyvision scans tracked Python files outside `src/` (which includes the `tests/` tree) as legitimate **usage** sources.
Today's flow in `tools/pyvision-260708`:

- `_find_python_files(args.directory)` — collects **definition** files inside the analyzed tree, with `tests/` excluded
  (line 760).
- `_find_usage_only_python_files(...)` — collects tracked Python files **outside** the analyzed tree (line 798). This is
  what brings the `tests/` tree back in _as a usage source_.
- `main()` builds `usage_file_infos = file_infos + usage_only_file_infos` (line 978) — this set includes test files.
- `imported_symbols = _batch_search_usage(all_symbols_to_check, usage_file_infos, …)` (line 1022) — uses the
  test-inclusive set, so a symbol imported only from a test file is considered "imported."
- A separate `non_test_usage_file_infos` (line 979) **already exists** but is only consulted for the private-symbol
  "improperly imported from non-test" check at line 1141.

Consequence: a public symbol used only by `tests/test_foo.py` passes pyvision today.

External-repo URI pragmas already follow the desired behavior: `_external_repo_references_symbol` (line 589) explicitly
filters out test files before searching. The intra-repo behavior is the inconsistent one we want to fix.

## Proposed Behavior

Treat test files as **not contributing** to the "is this public symbol used?" decision, intra-repo. Specifically:

1. **Public symbols**: A public symbol is "used" only if it is imported, or used via a tracked module alias, from a
   **non-test** Python file inside the repo (or from a documentation/code pragma target, or from an external repo URI
   pragma — both unchanged).
2. **Private symbols**: Already use the non-test path for the "imported from non-test" guard — _no change needed for
   that check._ The "private symbol must be used in its own file" check is also unaffected (private symbols can only
   live in non-test files because `_find_python_files` excludes tests).
3. **Pragma "stale" check**: A pragma is "stale" only when its symbol is already imported from a **non-test** Python
   file. (Today's check at line 678–686 of `_validate_pragmas` uses `imported_symbols`; after the change that set will
   already be non-test-only, so the check naturally tightens correctly.)
4. **`--epic-symbol` "already used" check**: Same as above — this check piggybacks on `imported_symbols`, which becomes
   non-test-only.
5. **Test-file pragmas (`# pyvision: tests/...`)**: Remain forbidden. The rationale changes from "test references are
   detected automatically" to "test references are not sufficient to keep a symbol alive." Update the error message
   accordingly so it doesn't lie.

### What counts as a "test file"

Reuse the existing `_is_test_file_path` helper (line 753), which considers any path with a `test`/`tests` component, or
a `.py` file whose name starts with `test_`. This is consistent with how external-repo scanning and the existing
private-symbol guard already classify tests.

Note: `conftest.py` files placed under a `tests/` directory will be excluded naturally. A `conftest.py` placed at the
repo root would _not_ be excluded by the current helper. We will accept that quirk — there is no `conftest.py` at the
repo root today, and adopting a stricter rule (e.g. exclude `conftest.py` anywhere) would be a separate decision. Flag
it in the plan but don't expand scope.

## Edge Cases & Risks

- **Hidden cascade in sase_104**: Any public symbol currently kept alive only by a test reference will start failing
  pyvision once the vendored script lands. We need to audit and remediate before (or in the same change as)
  re-vendoring. Remediation options per symbol:
  - Delete it (preferred when truly only test-exercised dead code).
  - Make it `private` and call it from a public path (when the test is exercising real production behavior through an
    internal helper).
  - Add a `# pyvision: <non-test path>` pragma when a legitimate non-Python consumer exists.
  - Add `--epic-symbol` if it's tied to a pending epic.
- **Module-alias usage from tests**: The existing chezmoi tests `test_module_alias_usage_from_tracked_tests` and
  `test_from_import_alias_usage_from_tracked_tests` assert the _opposite_ of the new contract. They must be
  **rewritten** to assert failure (and we'll add positive coverage where the same import comes from a non-test file).
- **Mixed-references test fixture**: A public symbol referenced from both a test file and a non-test file must continue
  to pass. New test coverage.
- **Pragma + test-only reference**: A symbol with a doc/repo pragma but _additionally_ imported only from a test file
  should NOT be reported as "stale pragma" — the pragma is still load-bearing. New test coverage.
- **Vendored script policy**: Per `tools/AGENTS.md`, the canonical source is
  `~/.local/share/chezmoi/home/bin/executable_pyvision`. We must edit there, commit there (using the sase commit skill),
  then re-vendor via `pyvendor`. We do **not** edit the `tools/pyvision-260708` copy directly.

## Status (as of 2026-05-12)

The chezmoi-side work is **already complete** and committed as `26cd5d7d`:

- `home/bin/executable_pyvision` now routes the public-symbol import scan through `non_test_usage_file_infos` (was
  `usage_file_infos`) and the `usage_file_infos` variable is removed.
- The test-file-pragma error message has been rewritten to the new rationale.
- `tests/bash/pyvision_test.sh` has rewrites of `test_module_alias_usage_from_tracked_tests` and
  `test_from_import_alias_usage_from_tracked_tests` to assert failure, an updated rejection message check, and new
  positive coverage for the mixed-references and "pragma not stale on test-only import" cases.

The vendored copy in this repo (`tools/pyvision-260708`) still has the **old** behavior. The remaining work
is everything in `sase_104`: re-vendor, doc updates, audit capture, and keeping `just check` green.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Modify the chezmoi source — **DONE** (commit `26cd5d7d`)

`~/.local/share/chezmoi/home/bin/executable_pyvision`:

- In `main()` (around lines 1014–1024), compute `imported_symbols` against `non_test_usage_file_infos` rather than
  `usage_file_infos`. `usage_file_infos` itself can be removed if it has no remaining consumers — confirm via grep
  before deleting.
- In `_validate_pragmas` (around lines 663–675), update the test-file-pragma error message so it no longer claims
  "Python test references are detected automatically." Replace with wording such as: _"references from test files are
  not sufficient to keep a public symbol used; delete the symbol, make it private and call it from a non-test path, or
  use a non-test pragma target."_
- Update the module docstring at the top of the file (line 3) only if it makes a claim about test references (it
  currently doesn't — verify before editing).

### 2. Update chezmoi tests — **DONE** (commit `26cd5d7d`)

`~/.local/share/chezmoi/tests/bash/pyvision_test.sh`:

- **Rewrite** `test_module_alias_usage_from_tracked_tests` (line 42) and
  `test_from_import_alias_usage_from_tracked_tests` (line 67) to assert that pyvision now **fails** with the symbol
  reported as unused.
- **Rewrite or extend** `test_pyvision_allows_private_imports_from_tracked_tests` (line 119): `build_widget` is
  currently kept alive only by a test import, which will start failing. Either:
  - drop the `build_widget` import from the test fixture and keep the focus on private-symbol import behavior, or
  - give `build_widget` a non-test consumer in the fixture.
- **Update** `test_pyvision_rejects_test_file_pragmas` (line 92) to match the new error message text.
- **Add** `test_pyvision_fails_when_public_symbol_only_used_in_tests` — a public function defined in `src/pkg/` with the
  _only_ import from `tests/test_foo.py`. Expect exit 1 and the standard "Unused public functions/classes" error.
- **Add** `test_pyvision_passes_when_symbol_used_in_both_tests_and_non_tests` — same definition, imports from both
  `tests/` and a non-test consumer (e.g. a sibling module in `src/pkg/`, or an `app.py` outside `src/`). Expect exit 0.
- **Add** `test_pyvision_pragma_not_stale_when_only_test_imports_exist` — a symbol with `# pyvision: docs/foo.md` and a
  test-only Python import. Expect exit 0 (pragma still needed, no "stale pragma" error).

Run `just check` (or whichever test runner chezmoi uses for `tests/bash/*.sh`) in the chezmoi repo before committing.

### 3. Commit the chezmoi change — **DONE** (commit `26cd5d7d`, `chezmoi apply --force` applied)

### 4. Re-vendor into sase_104

Run `pyvendor` to refresh `tools/pyvision-260708`. (If the date suffix rolls forward to today's date, update
`Justfile` references and any documentation/agent-memory references to the old filename. Grep for
`pyvision-260708` first to enumerate the touch points — at minimum: `Justfile` lines 112 and 262.)

### 5. Audit sase_104 for newly-unused public symbols

Run `just _lint-pyvision` after the re-vendor and capture the full "Unused public functions/ classes" report. Earlier
audit (pre-Q1) reported ~94 newly-unused public symbols. Per the user's Q1 answer, this CL **does not remediate
per-symbol** — instead:

- Record the full list (one entry per `(symbol_name, file_path)` pyvision printed, plus the command and the chezmoi
  commit SHA for traceability) as a new **SASE artifact** via the `sase_artifact` skill. The artifact is the
  authoritative TODO list for the follow-up cleanup CL.
- Decide on a tracking mechanism for follow-up work (open question below).

The audit work must still land in the **same CL** as the vendored script update — but as suppression entries, not
deletions. See step 6 for the suppression strategy.

### 6. Keep `just check` green via `--epic-symbol` suppression

`just check` runs `_lint-pyvision`, which exits non-zero whenever ANY public symbol is unused. We need to suppress the
~94 captured symbols without doing per-symbol cleanup here.

Use the existing `--epic-symbol <bead_id>(<symbol_name>)` escape hatch already wired into the script. Steps:

1. Create one **epic bead** that owns the follow-up cleanup of the captured symbol list (the artifact from step 5
   attaches to or references this bead).
2. Add a `--epic-symbol <epic_bead_id>(<symbol>)` entry to the `_lint-pyvision` recipe in `Justfile` for every flagged
   symbol. The recipe currently reads:
   ```
   _lint-pyvision: _setup
       BD_COMMAND=tools/sase_bead {{ venv_bin }}/python tools/pyvision-260708 src/sase
   ```
   becomes:
   ```
   _lint-pyvision: _setup
       BD_COMMAND=tools/sase_bead {{ venv_bin }}/python tools/pyvision-260708 src/sase \
           --epic-symbol <bead>(<sym1>) \
           --epic-symbol <bead>(<sym2>) \
           ...
   ```
3. The user-facing `pyvision *args` recipe at `Justfile` line 261 does **not** need the entries; it's an
   explicit-invocation recipe and we want manual runs to surface the list.

Why `--epic-symbol` and not pragmas: `--epic-symbol` validates that the bead is open and the symbol is genuinely unused,
so stale entries fail the lint as soon as cleanup lands. A `# pyvision: <path>` pragma would falsely imply the symbol is
referenced from `<path>`, which is not the case — it's just dead code awaiting removal.

Tradeoffs vs. alternatives:

- **Per-symbol pragmas** — wrong tool; would rot silently when symbols are removed.
- **A new pyvision flag (e.g. `--ignore-unused-file`)** — requires another chezmoi round trip; weakens the guarantee.
  Out of proportion for a one-time migration.
- **Inline remediation now** — explicitly out of scope per Q1; mixes mechanical lint cleanup with judgment calls.

If the inline list of ~94 `--epic-symbol` flags makes the Justfile recipe unwieldy, fall back to sourcing args from a
sibling file (e.g. `tools/pyvision_epic_symbols.txt` consumed via shell expansion). Decide based on the actual count
once captured.

### 7. Update documentation

- `tools/AGENTS.md` `pyvision-260708` section currently says: _"It scans tracked Python usage outside `src/`,
  including tests, so Python test references do not need pragmas."_ Rewrite to state the new contract: tests are scanned
  only for the private-symbol guard; public symbols require at least one non-test consumer.
- Update the "How do I whitelist a symbol" bullet that mentions _"Pragmas must not point at test files; Python test
  references are detected automatically"_ to reflect the new rationale.

### 8. Final verification

- `just install` in this ephemeral workspace dir first (per the `workspaces.md` gotcha).
- `just _lint-pyvision` passes after the `--epic-symbol` entries land.
- `just check` passes end-to-end in `sase_104`.
- Spot-check: temporarily drop one `--epic-symbol` entry and confirm pyvision flags that exact symbol; restore the
  entry.
- Spot-check: confirm a public symbol in `src/sase` that is referenced **only** from `tests/` appears in the captured
  audit output (verifies the new behavior is wired through the vendored copy, not just upstream).
- Chezmoi side is already validated upstream — bash regression suite covers the script logic.
- Confirm no other sibling repo (`../sase-*`) was touched (per `sase_sibling_commit_stop_hook`).

## Open questions for the user

- Should the tracking bead be a brand-new epic, or attached to an existing initiative (e.g. a pyvision/lint-hygiene
  parent bead)? Default: brand-new epic.
- Is in-Justfile listing of ~94 `--epic-symbol` entries acceptable, or should we pre-emptively split them into a sibling
  file? Default: inline unless the captured count is materially larger.

## Out of Scope

- Changing how external-repo URI pragmas treat test files (already correct).
- Broadening the "test file" definition beyond `_is_test_file_path` (e.g. root `conftest.py`). Note as a follow-up only.
- Any new pyvision flag to opt back into the old behavior. The new contract is unconditional.

# Plan: Make the total agent count in the Agents tab stand out

## Goal

Make the **total agent count** at the top of the `sase ace` Agents tab visually pop, while still looking beautiful and
cohesive with the rest of the info-panel design language. Today the count (e.g. `22`) is rendered in dim gray `#AFAFAF`,
sandwiched between nothing on the left and a bold cyan ` Agents` label on the right — so it reads as the _least_
important element on the line even though it's the headline figure.

## Current state

`src/sase/ace/tui/widgets/agent_info_panel.py:292-293`:

```python
text.append(f"{self._visible_agent_count}", style=self._TOTAL_COUNT_STYLE)
text.append(" Agents", style="bold #87D7FF")
```

with `_TOTAL_COUNT_STYLE = "#AFAFAF"` (line 14).

The same file already defines a vocabulary of "metric strip" styles for status counts:

```python
_COUNT_STYLES: dict[str, str] = {
    "asking":   "bold #FFAF00",
    "starting": "bold #1a1a1a on #87D7FF",   # filled badge
    "running":  "bold #00D7AF",
    "waiting":  "bold #AF87FF",
    "failed":   "bold #FF5F5F",
    "unread":   "bold #1a1a1a on #FFD700",   # filled badge
    "read":     "bold #5FD7FF",
}
```

So the design has two existing "badge tiers":

- **Bold colored text** for plain status counts.
- **Bold dark-text on bright background** for the two attention-grabbing states (`starting`, `unread`).

The total count currently doesn't participate in either tier — it's dimmer than every status count on the line, which is
exactly backwards.

## Design (chosen)

A **typographic-emphasis + subtle accent** treatment, NOT another background-filled badge.

```
▎22 Agents [3 stopped · 2 running · 1 waiting · 5 unread · 1 done]
```

Three pieces:

1. **Leading accent bar** `▎` (U+258E LEFT ONE QUARTER BLOCK) in `bold #5FAFFF`. One cell wide, no real estate cost.
   Plays the role of a left-margin rule in print typography — a tiny visual anchor that frames the headline number.
2. **Count itself** rendered in `bold #FFFFFF` (bright white). Pure white is currently unused anywhere on the info-panel
   line, so it reads instantly as "this is the headline".
3. **Label** ` Agents` unchanged — `bold #87D7FF`.

### Why not a background-fill badge?

The metric strip already reserves background-fills for `starting` and `unread` — the two attention-grabbing states. If I
gave the total count a filled badge too, it would:

- Compete visually with those status badges and dilute their meaning.
- Make the headline figure look like _just another status_, instead of the primary number.

A clean, bold, accented numeral sits _above_ the status-badge tier without crowding it.

### Why white, not gold/yellow?

`#FFD700` is already taken by the `unread` badge background and the auto-refresh countdown text. Reusing gold for the
total would muddy both signals. Bright white is unused on this line and gives the count its own unambiguous identity.

### Why the `▎` glyph specifically?

- Single-cell width — no horizontal layout impact.
- Renders cleanly in Fira Code (pinned in the visual-test fixtures), so the PNG goldens stay deterministic.
- Reads as a "ledger mark" — much more subtle than a full block `█` or a bullet `●`, both of which would feel heavy or
  list-like.

### Loading state

`set_loading(True)` renders `Agents: …` with no count, so it's left untouched.

## Implementation steps

1. **`src/sase/ace/tui/widgets/agent_info_panel.py`**
   - Replace the single constant
     ```python
     _TOTAL_COUNT_STYLE = "#AFAFAF"
     ```
     with two constants:
     ```python
     _TOTAL_COUNT_STYLE = "bold #FFFFFF"
     _TOTAL_COUNT_ACCENT_STYLE = "bold #5FAFFF"
     ```
   - In `_build_display_text` (non-loading branch, currently lines 292-293), prepend one `text.append` for the accent so
     the segment becomes:
     ```python
     text.append("▎", style=self._TOTAL_COUNT_ACCENT_STYLE)
     text.append(f"{self._visible_agent_count}", style=self._TOTAL_COUNT_STYLE)
     text.append(" Agents", style="bold #87D7FF")
     ```

2. **Regenerate PNG visual snapshots** that include the agents-tab info panel:
   - `tests/ace/tui/visual/snapshots/png/agents_list_120x40.png`
   - `tests/ace/tui/visual/snapshots/png/agents_selected_row_120x40.png`
   - `tests/ace/tui/visual/snapshots/png/agents_tools_panel_populated_120x40.png`
   - `tests/ace/tui/visual/snapshots/png/agents_unread_highlight_120x40.png`

   Procedure: `just test-visual -- --sase-update-visual-snapshots`, then eyeball each actual/expected/diff trio in
   `.pytest_cache/sase-visual/` to confirm the new look matches intent before committing the new goldens.

3. **`just check`** before reporting done (per `memory/short/build_and_run.md`).

## Files touched

- `src/sase/ace/tui/widgets/agent_info_panel.py` — code change (one renamed constant + one new constant + one extra
  `text.append`).
- Four PNG goldens — regenerated by the snapshot framework, not hand-edited.

## Out of scope

- Panel border titles in `src/sase/ace/tui/actions/agents/_display_panel_titles.py`. Those are per-group counts under a
  tag like `#myTag · 5`. Their visual role is to be the _secondary_ reading; keeping `_PANEL_COUNT_STYLE = "#AFAFAF"`
  dim lets the tag stay the focus.
- The auto-refresh countdown, view-mode badge, grouping-mode badge. None of those are part of "the total count".
- Adding a Textual CSS class for the count. Rich inline styling is the established pattern for this widget, and the
  change is local enough that introducing a class would be churn for no gain.

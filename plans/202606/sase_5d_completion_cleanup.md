# Complete sase-5d Verification Cleanup

## Context

Verification of the `sase-5d` model-alias migration found the implementation mostly complete, but one test still expects
the retired `@other` pre-override snapshot behavior. Since phase 4 removed the worker lane and made `worker` / `other`
ordinary configured aliases only, that test now fails under `just test`.

## Plan

1. Update the stale multi-model fan-out test so it reflects the completed phase 4 semantics:
   - `@other` is only a configured alias.
   - An active temporary default override does not give `@other` any displaced-model behavior.
   - The fan-out naming expectation should follow the ordinary configured alias target.
2. Run the focused test file that covers multi-model fan-out naming.
3. Re-run the relevant model-alias focused test set if the focused correction exposes related stale expectations.
4. Update the associated epic plan frontmatter from `status: wip` to `status: done`.
5. Run the required repository checks after file changes:
   - `just pyvision` after the epic bead is closed.
   - `just check` before final response.
6. Close the `sase-5d` epic bead only after the code/test/doc verification is clean.

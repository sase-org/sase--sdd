 Can you help me do an audit of the code related to the prompt input widget? Find any Vim keymaps or behaviors that would be useful in this widget but that are not currently implemented and implement them. Try to be thorough, but only implement features that are genuinely useful to users in the prompt input widget.

This is a large piece of work that should be split into phases. I'll let you decide how many phases to create, but
keep in mind that each phase will be completed by a distinct agent instance (i.e. a distinct `claude` / `gemini` /
`codex` / `qwen` / `opencode` command). Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the `sase plan`
command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

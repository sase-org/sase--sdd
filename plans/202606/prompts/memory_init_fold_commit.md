 When the `sase memory init` command is run, we currently throw an error if the working directory has any uncommitted file changes. Can you help me make it so, wen the only uncommitted file changes are the changes to markdown files in the memory/ directory that are causing `sase memory init` to recommend changes in the first place, that we prompt the user for a commit message and then commit those memory/ changes when committing the rest of the changes that the `sase memory init` command makes?

- We should use the user's commit message for the commit that the `sase memory init` command makes in this case.
- We should provide a default conventional commit tag (i.e. a `<tag>(<feature>): ` prefix before the commit message header line) for the commit message so the user doesn't need to worry about that.
- I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

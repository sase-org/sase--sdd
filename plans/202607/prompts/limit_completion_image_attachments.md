 When we send PDFs that were converted from markdown files or send images in Telegram when an agent completes, we are only supposed to send these if there are ten or less of them. This works for the PDF files but it seems like we allow an unlimited number of images to be sent in Telegram. Can you help me diagnose the root cause of this issue and fix it? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

 Can you help me add support for keyword arguments to the model directive that allow the user to override specific model aliases for the agent family that is launched by this prompt? For example I should be able to use `%m(opus, coder=sonnet)` to launch an agent that will use the Claude Sonnet model for any agents that specify the `@coder` model alias. Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

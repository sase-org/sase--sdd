  Can you help me add full support for the `<ctrl+t>` keymap to the sase-nvim repo? This should support file completion, saved file completion, and xprompt completion just like the prompt input widget. This is a large piece of work that should be split into phases. I'll let you decide how many phases to create, but
keep in mind that each phase will be completed by a distinct agent instance (i.e. a distinct `claude` / `gemini` /
`codex` command). Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill before making any file changes.

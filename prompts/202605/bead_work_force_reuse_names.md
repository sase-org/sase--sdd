 Can you help me make the agent prompts that are used by the agents launched by `sase bead work` use the `!` prefix supported by the `%name` directive so we always delete old agents of the same name if they exist? This way, if something goes wrong, I can kill all phase agents, kill the land agent, and then restart them all by running the appropriate `sase bead work` command. Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill before making any file changes.

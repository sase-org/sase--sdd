 The sase_fix_just chop (defined in my chezmoi repo) chop agent just failed (see the @~/.sase/projects/sase/artifacts/ace-run/20260522165618/error_report.md file for context). Can you help me diagnose the root cause of this issue and fix it? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill before making any file changes.
 

Sibling repos for this project are available in workspace-matched directories:
- core: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase-core/sase-core_11
- github: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase-github/sase-github_11
- telegram: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase-telegram/sase-telegram_11
- nvim: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase-nvim/sase-nvim_11
- chezmoi: /home/bryan/.local/share/chezmoi
When editing a sibling repo, use its workspace-matched directory, not the primary checkout.

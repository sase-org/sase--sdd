 #resume:ahs.1.plan  I don't think the `sase_tmux_target` output is necessary, right? Can't the
agent construct it from the other variables? Also, it would be better if we output the PID for `sase ace` instead of the
PID for `tmux`. This way the agent can inspect and profile the process (e.g. using `strace` or `py-spy`). Can you help
me fix these issues? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill before making any file changes.

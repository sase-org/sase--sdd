 I don't think the chezmoi sibling configuration is working right (see the sase.yml file in my chezmoi repo).
The "bm6" sase agent just made file changes in my chezmoi repo, but did not commit them (our commit finalizer should
have caught this). Can you help me diagnose the root cause of this issue and fix it? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill before making any file changes.


### Additional Requirements

- Agents should be able to ignore (i.e. leave uncommitted) changes in sibling repos when the sibling has the `workspace.strategy: none` config field set so the finalizer doesn't fail, but they should still be alerted about those changes and asked to commit them if that agent made those changes.

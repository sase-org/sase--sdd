 When I use the `,U` keymap, the "Updates" tab of the "SASE Admin Center" panel is opened, but then it takes a while (~2s I think) after the GitHub remotes are fetched (to check the installed versions versus the latest versions) for the y/n panel to pop up to confirm with the user before starting the update. I feel like we should be able to make this pop up instantly as soon as the updates tab finishes fetching from GitHub remotes. Can you help me fix this / make this faster? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

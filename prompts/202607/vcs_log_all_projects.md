 Can you help me add a new `-a|--all` option to the `sase vcs log` command (switch to using `-A` as the short option for `--author`)?

- This option should include git commits from all known sase projects.
- For this machine for example, the sase project, the bob-cli project, the actstat project, all of their linked repos, and multiple others (including projects from all VCS types) would have their commits included in the output when this option is used.

Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

 When sase auto-commits changes to my chezmoi repo (like when we add an xprompt using the `<ctrl+g>x` keymap from the prompt input widget), if the git index is locked, the commit fails (see the output below). Can you help me fix this by deleting this locked git index file in this case and retrying the commit (make sure to tell the user you needed to do this via a TUI toast)? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

 We currently use the `.f<N>`, `.w<N>`, and `.r<N>` suffices for agent names when the prompt contains `#fork` or it contains `%wait` or we populated this prompt as a "retry", respectively. Can you help me start using `.f-@`, `.w-@`, and `.r-@` instead so we re-use the special `@` agent name functionality? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

 I would like to give the prompt input widget the ability to stash one or more prompts somewhere permenant with a visual indicator somewhere when I can restore them. I should be able to stash the current prompt input widget's prompt with a keymap, stash ALL visible prompt input widget prompts with a keymap, and restore (i.e. pop off the stack) one or more old stashed prompts. Can you help me implement this? I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

This is a large piece of work that should be split into phases. I'll let you decide how many phases to create, but
keep in mind that each phase will be completed by a distinct agent instance (i.e. a distinct `claude` / `gemini` /
`codex` / `qwen` / `opencode` command). Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

 #fork:03m.cld Great! But there is one bug. Namely, the runtime for `PLAN/TALE APPROVED` agent child rows is still incrementing, even though the "plan" agent is killed after submitting the plan. This causes the root agent row's runtime to increment by 2 seconds every second. Can you help me fix this by making the runtimes for agents with the `PLAN/TALE APPROVED` statuses stop incrementing?

Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

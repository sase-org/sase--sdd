 #fork:018 Can you now help me fix the below error from the `sase init` command? I think the problem here was that the `sase amd init` command should be git committing its changes before the `sase memory init` command is run. Can you help me fix this? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

```
❯ sase init
SASE initialization check

Up to date:
  ok   init skills  provider skill files are current

Needs attention:
  run  init amd     overwrite managed AGENTS.md
    - overwrite AGENTS.md  managed AGENTS.md
  run  init memory  refresh 2 memory files and provider shims
    - update    memory/cli_rules.md  long-memory description frontmatter
    - overwrite AGENTS.md  managed AGENTS.md
  run  init sdd     update SDD README files and directory map
    - update    sdd/README.md  top-level README

### Additional Requirements

- The `sase amd init` command should always (unless explicitly configured not to via a CLI option) commit any changes it makes to git.

 We currently include bullets that look like the following at the top of sase agent chat markdown files:

```
- **TIMESTAMP:** 2026-06-27 11:13:17 EDT
- **MODEL:** codex/gpt-5.5
- **AGENT:** 082
```

Can you help me add a new bullet to this list that has a value of a markdown file path that points to the multi-agent prompt that initiated
the agent?

- This markdown file should contain the entire multi-agent prompt (i.e. all of the agent prompts and the frontmatter, if any).
- We should only add this new bullet if the agent was launched as a part of a multi-agent prompt.

Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

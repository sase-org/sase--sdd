 We recently added support to the prompt input widget for auto-adding and auto-removing the `}` that ends our alternation short-hand syntax. Can you help me generalize this support so we support auto-adding / auto-removing the following characters in any and every case where it is safe to do so (see https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs for a project that implements something similar for nvim--our implementation doesn't need to be so complex/configurable though)?: ', ", `, (), [], {}

Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

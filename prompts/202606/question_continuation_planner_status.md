 #fork:03m.cld.f1 Great! It looks like you mostly fixed this but there are some edge cases that are still broken. For example, the agent in the screenshot contained in the #sshot file was run with the `%approve` directive and asked a question using its `/sase_questions` skill, which led to a broken state. The correct state is described below:

- The "03w--0" agent was the one that asked the question, so it should have been marked with the QUESTION status until the question was auto-answered (since `%approve` was used), at which point the status of that agent child row should have changed to ANSWERED.
- The "03w--1" agent was the one that approved the plan, so it should have had a status of PLAN APPROVED (or TALE APPROVED--I'm not sure if we commit the plan file to sdd/tales/ when `%approve` is used or not) and the runtime should NOT be incrementing for the "03w--1" child agent row.

Can you help me fix this? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

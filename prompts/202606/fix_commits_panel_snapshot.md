 GitHub Actions is failing with the below error. Can you help me diagnose the root cause of this issue and fix it? If this is a flaky screenshot test, can you help me make it not flaky? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the
`sase plan propose` command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.

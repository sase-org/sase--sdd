 I think we have a flakey test (see the `just test` command's output below). Can you help me diagnose the root cause of this issue and fix it? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Submit your plan with the `sase plan`
command (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.
